# Driver Behaviour Analysis App

It is an app that provides to the user a driver scores according to the driving events.
The app capture 3 main driving events such as acceleration, braking, and cornering. 
The trip results are shown in different modes and graphs including maps. 
The user is able to navigate to get feedback in order to improve driving skills. 
The app uses a Room database, clean design, recycle view, intents, fragments, Activity and a Google maps API, this
project was part of my final research project on Driving behaviour analysis using smartphone sensors and machine learning techniques.

For more detail check the pdf of user manual and research to see the motivations and results.
